title = Push Notification Response
description = Push Authentication depends on the secure verification of information sent from the server to \
  the client, and from the client to the server. This allows the server to verify that the notification was received \
  by the original device, and for the device to verify that only the server sent out the original request.\n\
  \n\
  This endpoint provides the place for the device to return responses to the server to requests received either by QR \
  code or by push notification.

common.request.messageId.title = Message ID
common.request.messageId.description = Unique message identifier

  provided claims in the JWT.

  sent to the device via Push notification. This message is generally sent from the ForgeRock Authenticator app.

  the device via a QR code. This message is generally sent from the ForgeRock Authenticator app.

action.authenticate.request.jwt.description = Signed JWT containing claims:\n\
  * `response`: Response to challenge (Base64 encoding of the HmacSHA256 hashing of the decoded shared secret and the \
  decoded challenge)\n\
  * `deny`: Indication that this auth attempt should be shut down (boolean)

action.register.request.jwt.description = Signed JWT containing claims:\n\
  * `response`: Response to challenge (Base64 encoding of the HmacSHA256 hashing of the decoded shared secret and the \
  decoded challenge)\n\
  * `mechanismUid`: The device-specific identifier for the just-registered mechanism (string)\n\
  * `deviceId`: The registration token used by GCM or APNS (string)\n\
  * `deviceType`: `android` or `ios` (string)\n\
